🍁 Cryptographic encryption systems 🌿

🍁 Fibonacci sequence

🍁 Ceaser Cipher

🍁 Vigenère cipher

🍁 **GoldenFib cipher**

🌿 Building a secure data transmission system using the
Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio, i call it
the **GoldenFib cipher encryption technique**

🍁 The goldenFibEncrypt function encrypts the plaintext by shifting each character code using the corresponding Fibonacci number and adding it to the corresponding ASCII decimal value. 

🍁 The goldenFibDecrypt function decrypts the ciphertext by shifting each character code back using the golden ratio raised to the power of the character's position.
